This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the camera's preview before it's fully initialized.  It usually manifests as a blank preview or an error related to the camera not being available.  This often happens when trying to immediately access properties or methods of the camera object within the component's `useEffect` hook without accounting for the asynchronous nature of camera initialization.
